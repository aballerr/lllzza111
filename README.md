## stuff I would improve with more time

1. B/c the nft images are different sizes it can look a bit wonky. I'd put in filler background so the images look more aligned. Heights are also not 100% consistent which I would prefer
2. I'd put in a loading state for where the nft images should load
3. I'm not using any global state here b/c it's only 1 level but I'd prefer to use zustand or context to make it a bit cleaner
4. I'd prefer a paginated experience

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
